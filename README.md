# 🐙 MASTERING GIT WITH GITKRAKEN 🐙

In this project I have gone through mostly all the daily tasks that a **Data Scientist** do when interacting with GIT, such as:

👮 Giving access to another developer

👨‍👨‍👦‍👦   Cloning repo

🌿 Create and merge branches to other branches and to the main one

🔖 Tagging in order to have access to older versions

✅ Correcting errors when merging

⏫ Completing Pull and Merge requests 

⚒ Use of Releases
